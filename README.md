## Welcome to PAN - the Preconfigured Application Node!
Think of it as a **cybersecurity Swiss Army knife**, but in **Docker form**.  
One container to rule them all, deploy them all, and defend them all.  

### 🚀 Why PAN?  
- 🔧 Because setting up security tools manually is too much hassle.  
- 🔍 Because you'd rather focus on security, not troubleshooting dependencies.**  
- 🐳 **Because Docker makes everything easier (most of the time).  

## 🛠 Getting Started  
1. Clone the repository  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/PAN.git
   cd pan
   ```
2. Make the install script executable
   ```sh
   chmod +x install_pan.sh
   ```
3. Run the install script with your base domain as an option
   ```sh
   ./install_pan.sh -d <BASE_DOMAIN>
   ```
4. Let the chaos begin

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** PAN is designed to run on Ubuntu Server v22.0.4 LTS
